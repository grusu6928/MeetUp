**Team Members:** Amin Hijaz, Ermias Genet, George Rusu, Hamzah Shah

**Team Strengths and Weaknesses:**
###### George Rusu
Strengths: Extensive experience working with frontend and backend frameworks like React and Django. Experience with deployment, databases, and user login/authentication. 
Weaknesses: Django is python not Java. Not too comfortable with frontend development - more comfortable with setting up routing, endpoints, and testing for the frontend.
###### Ermias Genet
Strengths: Front end development ( familiar with React,  Js, bootstrap, good experience with Html/css), connecting APIs
Weaknesses: little SQL experience, not strong with java 
###### Amin Hijaz
Strengths: have some experience working with React(a long time ago), know some Js, html, and Css. Love Learning new stuff
Weaknesses: new to Java, databases(I used google firebase with React before but not SQL).
###### Hamzah Shah
Strengths: Databases (SQL), working with large datasets, functionality testing, Python, communication 
Weaknesses: Front end development


**Project Idea(s):**
### Idea 1 [This is the idea detailed in the PDF in our repo]
With everyone’s busy schedules, coordinating spontaneous meet-ups with friends on campus can be difficult. Our idea is to create a service to automate the process: it will match friends together considering their preferences (e.g. what activity to meet up for, distance willing to travel, time willing to spend, etc) as well as their location. The core algorithmic complexity comes from using these preferences and location constraints to form meet-up groups via a graph-based matching algorithm. For the sake of this project, we will limit our scope to Brown University students and the Brown University campus. 

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea approved

### Idea 2
A service that allows people to participate in online clothing exchange. You create an account, which takes in your name, location, lets you write a bio, and has you ticking off boxes that indicate what kind of clothes you are most passionate about (ie sneakerhead vs skirts vs pants vs tops only). You then post pictures of apparel you are willing to part with. For each listing you can note if you are interested in having this item be listed for purchase, and/or if you are open to the idea of clothing exchange. Your listing and your profile are then put on a stack that is shown to other app users in the area with similar interests. The app lets you link your own website, letting other people visit your online store, poshmark, or mercari store if you have any

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea not approved. Not enough algorithmic complexity detailed. If you want to do this idea, feel free to add details and resubmit!

### Idea 3
VoiceFinder: a browser extension that transcribes videos and allows for a Ctrl/Cmd find feature. Often times we skim through videos trying to find the content we want. With this extension, you would be able to search and see if any key words/phrases have been detected in the video. This would save users a lot of time in searching for specific content in videos.

**HTA Approval (dpark20):** Idea not approved. Same reason as above. Needs more specification.

Good ideas, but make sure to add more detail if you want to do Idea 2 or 3! Looking forward to seeing what you build.
